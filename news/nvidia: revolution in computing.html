            7px ;">Founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, NVIDIA's history is defined by pivotal technological shifts that created new markets.

​1. The Genesis of the GPU (1990s)
​Founding Premise: The co-founders recognized that the future of personal computing would be centered around graphics, gaming, and multimedia.

​The GPU Invention (1999): The release of the GeForce 256 marked the official introduction of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). NVIDIA defined the GPU as a single-chip processor with integrated Transformation, Clipping, and Lighting (T&L) engine, a major architectural leap that significantly offloaded geometric calculations from the main CPU and enabled complex 3D graphics.

​2. The CUDA Revolution (2000s)
​Parallel Computing Insight: In the mid-2000s, NVIDIA realized the highly parallel architecture of the GPU—designed to process thousands of pixels simultaneously—was ideal for general-purpose scientific and engineering calculations.

​Launch of CUDA (2006): The introduction of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a parallel computing platform and programming model, was a transformative event. CUDA enabled developers to program the GPU for non-graphics tasks, fundamentally shifting the GPU from a graphics accelerator into a general-purpose parallel processor (GPGPU). This innovation became the technical foundation for the subsequent AI and machine learning boom.

​3. Dominance in AI and Data Centers (2010s–Present)
​The Deep Learning Engine: Researchers in the 2010s found that the CUDA-enabled GPUs provided the massive computational power required to efficiently train large neural networks for deep learning. NVIDIA GPUs became the indispensable hardware for the AI industry, enabling breakthroughs like the image recognition model AlexNet (2012).

​Strategic Expansion: The company's focus expanded rapidly into the Data Center market, which now encompasses AI training, inference, high-performance computing (HPC), and accelerated networking. The development of specialized GPU architectures (e.g., Volta, Ampere, Hopper) and associated software stacks solidified its dominance.

​Ecosystem Development: Key platforms such as DRIVE (for autonomous vehicles), Clara (for healthcare imaging), and Omniverse (for industrial simulation and digital twins) position NVIDIA as a full-stack computing company whose impact extends across major industries.

​NVIDIA's developmental strategy has consistently involved making significant architectural bets and building a comprehensive software ecosystem (CUDA) around its hardware, successfully monetizing the shift towards accelerated, parallel, and AI-driven computing.</p>
